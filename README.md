# LearnOpenGL-Lab

My code lab for Learn OpenGL based on GLFW, glad. All of these codes for studying.

## TODO Exercies

- Basic Lighting

  - [ ] Do Phong shading in view space instead of world space: solution.
  - [ ] Implement Gouraud shading instead of Phong shading. If you did things right the lighting should look a bit off (especially the specular highlights) with the cube object. Try to reason why it looks so weird: solution.

## Environments

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- C/C++ Tools chain: Visual Studio Community 2019 Relese - x86_amd64
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Dependencies

- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw). The `.lib` file for GLFW is for Windows x64.
